# Resources Module Update - Complete

## Overview
Updated the Resources module tabs and implemented contextually relevant mock data for each tab, following the same pattern used for the Events module.

## Changes Made

### 1. Tab Configuration (`src/lib/modules/tabs-registry.ts`)
Updated the Resources module tabs from 10 tabs to 8 tabs with the following structure:

**New Tab Order:**
1. **Library** (All Resources) - `library` - Table view
2. **Guides** - `guides` - List view
3. **Courses** - `courses` - Table view
4. **Trainings** - `trainings` - Calendar view
5. **Grants** - `grants` - Table view
6. **Publications** - `publications` - Table view
7. **Glossary** - `glossary` - Table view
8. **Troubleshooting** - `troubleshooting` - List view

**Removed Tabs:**
- All Resources â†’ Renamed to "Library"
- Templates (moved to other modules)
- Videos (consolidated into other resources)
- Best Practices (integrated into Guides)
- Case Studies (integrated into Publications)
- Downloads (integrated into Library)
- Community (moved to Community module)
- FAQ (consolidated into Troubleshooting)

### 2. Mock Data Implementation (`src/lib/modules/resources-mock-data.ts`)
Created comprehensive mock data generator with contextually relevant data for each tab:

#### **Library Tab**
- Production planning templates
- Safety protocol guides
- Equipment setup checklists

- Various production documentation
- Categories: template, guide, checklist, manual, workbook

#### **Guides Tab**

- Rich with examples and visuals

#### **Courses Tab**

- Professional bootcamps
- Intensive training courses
- Educational programs with assignments
- Duration tracking (4-12 weeks)
- Enrollment status management

#### **Trainings Tab**
- Safety certification workshops
- Equipment operation training
- Compliance training sessions
- Software platform training
- Professional development workshops
- Scheduled sessions with attendance tracking
- Types: certification, workshop, bootcamp, refresher, compliance

#### **Grants Tab**
- Federal, state, and local funding opportunities
- Private foundation grants
- Arts and culture funding
- Innovation and development grants
- Application requirements and deadlines
- Funding amounts ($5,000 - $55,000 range)

#### **Publications Tab**
- Industry journals and magazines
- Research whitepapers
- Annual reports and studies
- Technical handbooks
- Best practice documentation
- Peer-reviewed content
- Page counts (20-100 pages)

#### **Glossary Tab**
- Industry terminology definitions
- Production, technical, audio, lighting terms
- Business and stage terminology
- Usage examples and context
- Related terms and cross-references
- Categorized by domain

#### **Troubleshooting Tab**
- Common technical issues
- Step-by-step solutions
- Root cause analysis
- Prevention tips
- Severity levels: critical, high, medium, low
- Audio, lighting, video, and power issues

### 3. Page Integration
Updated both module page components to use the new resources mock data:

- **`src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/workspace/[workspaceId]/[module]/[tab]/page.tsx`**
  - Added import for `generateResourcesMockData`
  - Integrated resources into the mock data conditional chain

- **`src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/workspace/[workspaceId]/[module]/page.tsx`**
  - Added import for `generateResourcesMockData`
  - Integrated resources into the mock data conditional chain

## Technical Details

### Mock Data Structure
Each tab generates 20 items by default with the following properties:
- Unique IDs
- Contextually relevant names and descriptions
- Appropriate status values for each tab type
- Priority levels (urgent, high, normal, low)
- Assignees with realistic names and roles
- Date tracking (created, updated, due dates)
- Tags specific to each resource type
- Comment and attachment counts

### Data Characteristics
- **Library**: Templates, guides, checklists with downloadable files
- **Guides**: Difficulty-based tutorials with detailed instructions
- **Courses**: Multi-week programs with duration and enrollment tracking
- **Trainings**: Scheduled sessions with attendance limits
- **Grants**: Funding opportunities with amounts and deadlines
- **Publications**: Research content with page counts and peer review
- **Glossary**: Terms with categories and usage examples
- **Troubleshooting**: Issues with severity levels and solutions

## Implementation Pattern
Followed the same pattern as the Events module:
1. Define tab configuration in `tabs-registry.ts`
2. Create dedicated mock data file with contextual generators
3. Integrate into page components with conditional logic
4. Use generic view system (no custom components)

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Navigate to Resources module in the application
2. Switch between tabs to verify contextual data
3. Check that each tab displays appropriate mock data
4. Verify view switching works correctly for each tab
5. Confirm item detail drawer shows contextual information

## Next Steps
The Resources module is now fully implemented with contextually relevant mock data. When connecting to the actual database:
1. Replace mock data generators with Supabase queries
2. Update data structures to match the schema
3. Implement CRUD operations for each resource type
4. Add filtering and search functionality
5. Implement file upload for attachments
