# Admin Module Refactor Summary

## Overview
Refactored the admin module to remove the redundant profile tab and build out each tab contextually at the organization admin level using the tabs-registry system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Redundant Profile Tab
- **Removed**: `admin-profile` tab from `tabs-registry.ts`
- **Reason**: Profile tab was redundant as user profile management should be at the individual user level, not organization admin level
- **Updated**: All order numbers in the admin tabs array (decreased by 1)

### 2. Created Missing Tab Components
Created 4 new admin tab components to match the registry:

- **`billing-tab.tsx`** - Subscription & billing management
- **`security-tab.tsx`** - Security settings & logs
- **`roles-permissions-tab.tsx`** - Access control & permissions
- **`integrations-tab.tsx`** - Third-party integrations

All new components follow the same pattern as existing admin tabs with:
- i18n support via `useTranslations()`
- Card-based UI structure
- Placeholder content for future implementation

### 3. Refactored Admin Page
**File**: `src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/admin/page.tsx`

**Before**: Hardcoded tabs with manual component imports
**After**: Dynamic tab system driven by `tabs-registry.ts`

Key improvements:
- Tabs are now dynamically loaded from `getModuleTabs("admin")`
- Tab components are mapped via a `tabComponents` object
- Icons and colors are dynamically applied from registry
- TabsList now uses flexible wrapping layout for better responsiveness
- All tabs are filterable by `enabled` status

### 4. Created Admin Component Index
**File**: `src/components/admin/index.ts`

Centralized exports for:
- Main admin tabs (registry-driven)
- Legacy tabs (available but not in main navigation)

## Current Admin Tab Structure

| Order | Tab Slug | Component | Icon | Description |
|-------|----------|-----------|------|-------------|
| 0 | overview | AdminOverviewTab | Gauge | Organization overview & metrics |
| 1 | organization | OrganizationSettingsTab | Building2 | Organization settings & profile |
| 2 | members | MembersManagementTab | UserSquare2 | Team member management |
| 3 | roles-permissions | RolesPermissionsTab | Shield | Access control & permissions |
| 4 | billing | BillingTab | CreditCard | Subscription & billing |
| 5 | security | SecurityTab | Lock | Security settings & logs |
| 6 | automations | AutomationsTab | Bot | Workflow automation rules |
| 7 | integrations | IntegrationsTab | Zap | Third-party integrations |
| 8 | webhooks | WebhooksTab | Webhook | Webhook configurations |
| 9 | api-tokens | ApiTokensTab | Key | API access tokens |

## Legacy Components Preserved
The following tabs exist but are not in the main admin navigation:
- `custom-statuses-tab.tsx` - Organization-wide custom statuses
- `checklist-templates-tab.tsx` - Checklist template management
- `recurrence-rules-tab.tsx` - Recurring task rules
- `plugins-tab.tsx` - Plugin marketplace

These can be integrated into the Organization tab or accessed through other routes as needed.

## Benefits of This Refactor

1. **Consistency**: Admin module now follows the same pattern as other modules in the system
2. **Maintainability**: Tabs are centrally defined in the registry
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to add, remove, or reorder tabs via configuration
4. **Scalability**: Tab configuration can be stored per-organization in the database
5. **Context-Appropriate**: All tabs are now focused on organization-level administration

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. **Implement Full Functionality**: Currently most tabs have placeholder content
2. **Add Supabase Integration**: Connect tabs to actual data sources
3. **Role-Based Tab Visibility**: Show/hide tabs based on user permissions
4. **Tab Customization UI**: Allow admins to configure which tabs are visible
5. **Legacy Tab Integration**: Decide whether to integrate legacy tabs or remove them
