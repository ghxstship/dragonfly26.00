## Key Differentiators

### Reports vs Analytics vs Insights
- **Reports**: Generated documents for stakeholders (static, scheduled, exported)
- **Analytics**: Interactive data exploration and visualization (real-time, dynamic)
- **Insights**: Strategic direction and intelligent recommendations (forward-looking, actionable)

### Industry Agnostic Design
All tabs are designed to be universally compatible across industries:
- No industry-specific terminology
- Focus on universal business concepts (objectives, metrics, performance)
- Flexible data structures that adapt to any domain

## Updated Files

### Core Registry Files
- `src/lib/modules/registry.ts` - Updated module definition
- `src/lib/modules/tabs-registry.ts` - Complete tab restructure for all three modules

### Insights Module (formerly Goals)
- `src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/insights/page.tsx` - Main page component
- `src/components/insights/objectives-list.tsx` - List view component
- `src/components/insights/objectives-hierarchy.tsx` - Hierarchy view component
- `src/components/insights/create-objective-dialog.tsx` - Create dialog
- `src/components/insights/objective-detail.tsx` - Detail panel

### Supporting Files
- `src/lib/modules/item-type-mapper.ts` - Updated mapping for insights
- `src/lib/create-actions-registry.ts` - Updated create action for objectives

## Mock Data Examples

### Insights Module Objectives
The mock data now includes industry-agnostic strategic objectives:
1. **Increase Customer Satisfaction Score** - 90% target (service quality)
2. **Reduce Operational Costs** - 15% reduction (efficiency)
3. **Expand Market Presence** - 3 new markets (growth)

These examples work across any industry: manufacturing, services, tech, healthcare, etc.

## Migration Guide

### For Developers
1. Update any imports from `@/components/goals/*` to `@/components/insights/*`
2. Change component names: `Goals*` â†’ `Objectives*`
3. Update module references from `goals` to `insights`

### For Users
1. The "Goals" module is now "Insights" in navigation
2. All existing goals data will be preserved (database schema unchanged)
3. New terminology: "Goals" â†’ "Objectives", "OKRs" â†’ "Key Results"

## Next Steps

### Recommended Implementation Priority
1. âœ… Core module rename (Goals â†’ Insights)
2. âœ… Tab registry updates
3. ðŸ”„ Create placeholder components for new tabs
4. ðŸ“‹ Implement Reports module tabs with appropriate mock data
5. ðŸ“‹ Implement Analytics module tabs with appropriate mock data
6. ðŸ“‹ Implement Insights module tabs with appropriate mock data
7. ðŸ“‹ Database migrations (if schema changes needed)
8. ðŸ“‹ I18n updates for new terminology

## Benefits

### Clarity & Organization
- Clear separation of concerns between the three modules
- No redundancy - each tab serves a unique purpose
- Logical progression: Analytics â†’ Reports â†’ Insights

### Scalability
- Easy to add industry-specific tabs within each module
- Extensible structure for future AI-powered features
- Supports both manual and automated data flows

### User Experience
- Intuitive navigation
- Consistent terminology
- Purpose-built views for each use case
