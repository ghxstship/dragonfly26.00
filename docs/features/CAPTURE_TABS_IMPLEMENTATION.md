# Photo and Scan Capture Tabs Implementation

## Overview
Fullstack implementation of Photo and Scan capture functionality in the right sidebar's Capture group, enabling users to capture documents and photos directly from their device cameras.

## Implementation Date
October 15, 2025

## Components Created

### 1. File Upload Hook (`src/hooks/use-file-upload.ts`)
Comprehensive hook for handling file uploads to Supabase Storage with the following features:
- Single and multiple file upload support
- Progress tracking
- File validation (size, type)
- Image compression
- Data URL to File conversion
- Automatic database record creation
- Error handling and recovery

**Key Functions:**
- `useFileUpload()` - Main hook for file operations
- `validateFile()` - Client-side file validation
- `compressImage()` - Image optimization before upload
- `dataURLtoFile()` - Convert camera captures to File objects

### 2. Photo Tab Content (`src/components/shared/photo-tab-content.tsx`)
Full-featured photo capture interface with:
- **Camera Access**: Direct device camera access via MediaDevices API
- **Photo Capture**: Capture photos at 1920x1080 resolution
- **Preview & Retake**: Review photos before saving
- **Image Upload**: Upload multiple images from device
- **Compression**: Automatic image optimization (max 1920x1080, 85% quality)
- **Storage**: Saves to `media` bucket under `photos/` folder
- **Real-time Progress**: Visual feedback during upload

**Features:**
- Environment-facing camera preference (back camera on mobile)
- Capture in JPEG format with 90% quality
- File validation (10MB max, JPEG/PNG/WEBP/HEIC)
- Toast notifications for success/errors
- Gallery view integration (placeholder)

### 3. Scan Tab Content (`src/components/shared/scan-tab-content.tsx`)
Document scanning interface with:
- **Document Scanner**: Camera-based document capture
- **Scanning Guide**: Visual frame overlay for alignment
- **Enhancement**: Basic contrast adjustment for readability
- **PDF Upload**: Direct PDF file upload support (50MB max)
- **Preview & Rescan**: Review scans before saving
- **Storage**: Saves to `documents` bucket under `scans/` folder

**Features:**
- Document alignment guides (corner markers)
- High-quality JPEG capture (95% quality for text clarity)
- Automatic document enhancement (contrast adjustment)
- PDF upload support for pre-existing documents
- Scanned documents viewer integration (placeholder)

## Storage Structure

### Buckets Used
1. **media** bucket (for photos)
   - Path: `{workspace_id}/photos/{timestamp}-{filename}`
   - Public: No (workspace-scoped)
   - Max size: 10MB per photo

2. **documents** bucket (for scans)
   - Path: `{workspace_id}/scans/{timestamp}-{filename}` (camera scans)
   - Path: `{workspace_id}/uploads/{timestamp}-{filename}` (PDF uploads)
   - Public: No (workspace-scoped)
   - Max size: 50MB per document

### Database Records
All uploads create records in the `files` table:
```sql
- id: UUID
- workspace_id: UUID (from current workspace)
- name: Original filename
- type: MIME type
- storage_path: Full path in storage bucket
- size_bytes: File size
- file_type: 'media' | 'other'
- uploaded_by: Current user ID
- custom_fields: JSON metadata
  - captureMethod: 'camera' | 'scan' | 'upload'
  - capturedAt/scannedAt/uploadedAt: ISO timestamp
  - documentType: 'scanned_document' | 'pdf' (for scans)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Camera Access
```typescript
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  video: { 
    facingMode: 'environment',
    width: { ideal: 1920 },
    height: { ideal: 1080 }
  },
  audio: false
})
```

### Canvas Capture
Both components use HTML5 Canvas for image capture:
1. Draw video frame to canvas
2. Apply enhancements (scans only)
3. Convert to data URL (JPEG)
4. Convert to File object
5. Compress if needed
6. Upload to Supabase Storage

### Upload Flow
1. **Client-side validation**: File size and type
2. **Image processing**: Compression/optimization
3. **Storage upload**: Supabase Storage API
4. **Database record**: Create file entry in `files` table
5. **Cleanup on error**: Remove storage file if DB insert fails
6. **User feedback**: Toast notifications

## Security Considerations

### Permissions
- Camera access requires user permission (browser prompt)
- Uploads require authenticated user
- Files are workspace-scoped (RLS policies apply)

### Validation
- Client-side: File size, type, format
- Server-side: Supabase Storage handles validation
- RLS policies: Workspace membership required

### Privacy
- Camera stream stopped after capture
- No automatic uploads - user confirmation required
- Files stored in private buckets (not publicly accessible)

## Browser Compatibility

### Required APIs
- MediaDevices.getUserMedia() - Camera access
- Canvas 2D Context - Image manipulation
- FileReader API - File handling
- Blob/File API - Binary data

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome/Edge: ✅ Full support
- Safari: ✅ Full support (iOS 14.3+)
- Firefox: ✅ Full support
- Mobile browsers: ✅ (with camera permissions)

## Dependencies

### NPM Packages
- `lucide-react` - Icons
- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Storage and database
- React 18+ (hooks)
- Next.js 14+ (framework)

### Internal Dependencies
- `@/hooks/use-file-upload` - File upload logic
- `@/lib/hooks/use-toast` - Toast notifications
- `@/store/ui-store` - Current workspace state
- `@/components/ui/*` - UI components

## Performance Considerations

### Image Compression
- Photos: 1920x1080 max, 85% quality
- Scans: No compression (preserve text quality)
- Average compressed size: 200-500KB per photo

### Upload Performance
- Single file: ~1-3 seconds (depends on network)
- Multiple files: Sequential upload (one at a time)
- Progress tracking for user feedback

### Memory Management
- Canvas cleared after capture
- Camera stream stopped when not in use
- Data URLs cleared after upload

## Known Limitations

1. **Browser Support**: Requires modern browser with camera API
2. **Mobile Safari**: May require HTTPS for camera access
3. **File Size**: Limited by storage bucket configuration
4. **Sequential Upload**: Multiple files upload one at a time
5. **No Offline**: Requires network connection for upload
6. **Basic Enhancement**: Scan enhancement is rudimentary

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working
- Check browser permissions
- Ensure HTTPS connection (required on mobile)
- Try different browser
- Check if camera is in use by another app

### Upload Fails
- Check network connection
- Verify file size within limits
- Check authentication status
- Verify workspace access

### Poor Scan Quality
- Ensure good lighting
- Keep document flat and aligned
- Try multiple captures
- Use PDF upload for better quality
