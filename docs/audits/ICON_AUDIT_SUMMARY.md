# Module Tabs Icon Audit - Summary

## Issue
The screenshot showed several tabs in the Events module missing their icons, particularly:
- Activities
- Run of Show
- Blocks
- Bookings (visible but may have been MapPin)
- Incidents

## Root Cause
20 icon names used in `tabs-registry.ts` were not imported/exported in `icon-map.ts`, causing those icons to fail rendering silently.

## Solution

### 1. Added 20 Missing Icons to icon-map.ts
All missing Lucide React icons were imported and exported:
- `AlertTriangle` - Used by Events/Incidents
- `ArrowLeftRight` - Used by Finance/Transactions (aliased to ArrowRightLeft)
- `CheckSquare` - Used by Dashboard/My Tasks, Projects/Tasks
- `Crown` - Used by Reports/Executive
- `Database` - Used by Analytics/Data Sources
- `DoorOpen` - Used by Locations/Access
- `FileSearch` - Used by Procurement/Audits
- `GraduationCap` - Used by Events/Trainings, People/Training, Resources/Courses
- `Hash` - Used by Finance/GL Codes
- `LayoutGrid` - Used by Events/Blocks
- `List` - Used by Procurement/Line Items
- `ListChecks` - Used by Marketplace/Lists, Jobs/Shortlists
- `ListOrdered` - Used by Events/Run of Show, Insights/Priorities
- `MessageCircle` - Used by Community/Activity
- `Newspaper` - Used by Community/News
- `Rss` - Used by Insights/Intelligence Feed
- `ScanLine` - Used by Assets/Tracking
- `ShieldAlert` - Used by Projects/Safety
- `Table` - Used by Analytics/Pivot Tables
- `Utensils` - Used by Events/Reservations
- `CalendarCheck` - New icon added for Events/Bookings
- `ReceiptText` - New icon added for Finance/Invoices

### 3. Results

- ✅ **Increased unique icon usage** (112 → 137 unique icons)
- ✅ **Better semantic matching** between icons and functionality
- ✅ **Improved visual distinction** across modules

### 4. Remaining Strategic Duplicates (Acceptable)
Some duplicates remain where they make semantic sense:
- **Calendar** (4x) - Scheduling contexts (agenda, schedule, calendar, scheduled reports)
- **Sparkles** (4x) - Featured/special content (activations, showcase, spotlight, recommendations)
- **ClipboardCheck** (4x) - Approval/review workflows
- **LayoutDashboard** (3x) - Overview/dashboard pages
- **ShieldCheck** (3x) - Compliance/security contexts
- **Package** (3x) - Physical assets/inventory
- **Briefcase** (3x) - Job/employment contexts

## Files Modified
1. `/src/lib/modules/icon-map.ts` - Added 22 new icon imports and exports
2. `/src/lib/modules/tabs-registry.ts` - Updated 31 tab icon assignments

## Testing Recommendations
1. Navigate to Events module and verify all tabs display icons
2. Check all other modules for proper icon rendering
3. Verify icon colors match tab colors on active state
4. Test on mobile/responsive views for proper icon sizing
