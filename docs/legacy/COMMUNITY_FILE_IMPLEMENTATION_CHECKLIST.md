## Notes & Decisions

### Key Decisions Made
- âœ… Use RLS instead of application-level permission checks
- âœ… Support multiple external storage providers
- âœ… Implement workflows at database level
- âœ… Use materialized views for analytics
- âœ… Keep existing UI structure, add features additively

### Open Questions
- [ ] Retention policy for file activities?
- [ ] Storage limits per workspace?
- [ ] Pricing model for external storage sync?
- [ ] Support for encrypted files?
- [ ] Support for folder permissions (inherit)?

### Future Considerations
- Real-time collaborative editing (Yjs, OT)
- Advanced DLP features
- eDiscovery support
- Mobile apps
- Desktop sync client
- API for third-party integrations
