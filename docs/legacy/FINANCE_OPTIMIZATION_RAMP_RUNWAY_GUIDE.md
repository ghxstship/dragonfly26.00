  'workspace-uuid',
  'Senior Manager Expense Limit',
  'expense_limit',
  '{"max_amount": 5000, "currency": "USD", "per_transaction": true, "requires_receipt": true}'::jsonb,

## Performance Considerations

### Optimized Queries
- Indexed workspace_id on all tables
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Partial indexes for active records only
- GENERATED columns for automatic calculations

### JSONB Usage
- Flexible schema for rules, conditions, actions
- Full GIN indexing support available
- Efficient storage for variable structures
- Easy to query with JSON operators

---

## Security Model

### Workspace Isolation
All tables enforce workspace-based access:
```sql
CREATE POLICY table_workspace_access ON table_name
    FOR ALL USING (
        workspace_id IN (
            SELECT workspace_id FROM workspace_members 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
```

### Nested Access Control
Child tables inherit parent workspace access:
```sql
-- Example: forecast_data_points inherits from financial_forecasts
CREATE POLICY forecast_data_points_access ON forecast_data_points
    FOR ALL USING (
        forecast_id IN (
            SELECT id FROM financial_forecasts 
            WHERE workspace_id IN (
                SELECT workspace_id FROM workspace_members 
                WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
            )
        )
    );
```

---

## Migration Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Existing Finance module tables (budgets, financial_transactions, etc.)
- RLS policies enabled on workspace_members
- update_updated_at() trigger function exists

### Deployment Command
```bash
cd /Users/julianclarkson/Documents/Dragonfly26.00
npx supabase db push --include-all
```

### Expected Results
- 19 new tables created
- 110+ indexes created
- 19 RLS policies enabled
- 12 triggers created
- 14 realtime subscriptions added
- Zero downtime (no existing data modified)

### Rollback Strategy
If needed, tables can be safely dropped as they have no dependencies on existing Finance tables:
```sql
-- Rollback (if necessary)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS financial_kpis CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS rule_execution_log CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS automated_financial_rules CASCADE;
-- ... (continue for all 19 tables)
```
