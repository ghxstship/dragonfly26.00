    inspection_status, status
) VALUES (
    '...', '...', '...', 'pass', 'accepted'
);
```

### Track Vendor Performance
```sql
INSERT INTO vendor_performance (
    workspace_id, vendor_id, evaluation_period,
    period_start, period_end, on_time_delivery_rate,
    overall_rating
) VALUES (
    '...', '...', '2025-Q4',
