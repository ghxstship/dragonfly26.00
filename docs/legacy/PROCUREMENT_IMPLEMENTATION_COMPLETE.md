### 3. Mock Data Implementation

**New Data Generators Created:**

#### `generateReceivingData()`
Generates realistic goods receipt records with:
- Auto-generated receipt numbers (REC-YYYYMMDD-#####)
- Inspection statuses (pass, fail, pending, not_required)
- Receipt statuses (received, partially_received, inspection, accepted, rejected)
- Quantity variance tracking (ordered vs received)
- Discrepancy flags and priority assignment
- Vendor assignments
- Attachment counts (packing slip photos)

**Sample Data:**
```
Receipt #REC-20251015-00001
PO-00202400 • Global Supplies Inc • 48 of 50 units received
Status: inspection | Priority: high | Discrepancy: Yes
```

#### `generateMatchingData()`
Generates realistic three-way match records with:
- Match statuses (pending, matched, partial_match, no_match, approved, rejected)
- Variance calculations (quantity, price, total, percentage)
- Payment approval indicators
- Multi-document linking (PO, Receipt, Invoice)
- Vendor assignments
- Priority based on variance percentage

**Sample Data:**
```
Invoice #INV-050000 • PO-00202400
Global Supplies Inc • PO: $12,500 • Invoice: $12,250 • Variance: -$250 (2%)
Status: partial_match | Priority: normal | Approved for Payment: No
```

**Custom Fields Included:**
- `inspection_status`, `quantity_ordered`, `quantity_received`, `has_discrepancy`
- `match_status`, `po_amount`, `invoice_amount`, `total_variance`, `variance_percentage`
- `approved_for_payment`, `quantity_discrepancy`, `price_discrepancy`

#### Organizations Tab Enhancements
- Vendor performance indicators (star ratings)
- Total spend column (for vendors)
- On-time delivery percentage
- Vendor type filter (client, vendor, both)
- "View Orders" quick action

#### Reviews Tab Enhancements

- KPI charts: On-time delivery, Quality score, Compliance
- Performance history by period
- Comparison metrics

#### Contacts Tab Enhancements
- Contact types (primary, accounting, sales, technical, emergency)
- Primary contact designation
- Click-to-call/email actions

#### Documents Tab Enhancements

## 💡 Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Unified Vendor/Company Model
**Decision:** Use Companies module for vendor management instead of separate Vendors tab

**Why:**
- Vendors ARE companies (companies you buy from)
- A company can be both vendor AND client
- Single source of truth
- Reduces duplication
- Better user experience

**Implementation:**
- `vendor_performance.vendor_id` → `companies.id`
- `vendor_contacts.vendor_id` → `companies.id`
- `vendor_documents.vendor_id` → `companies.id`

### 2. Additive Schema Changes
**Decision:** Add new tables rather than modify existing ones

**Why:**
- Zero breaking changes
- Easy rollback
- Can test in isolation
- Backward compatible

**Exception:** Enhanced `purchase_orders` with 11 new columns (all nullable or with defaults)

### 3. Auto-Generated Identifiers
**Decision:** Use sequences for requisition and receipt numbers

**Why:**
- Consistent number format
- No collisions
- Human-readable
- Sortable chronologically

**Format:**
- Requisitions: REQ-YYYYMMDD-#####
- Receipts: REC-YYYYMMDD-#####

### 4. JSONB for Flexibility
**Decision:** Use JSONB for approval levels, recurrence patterns, custom fields

**Why:**
- Flexible schema
- No migrations for rule changes
- Complex data structures
- Easy to extend

**Examples:**
- `approval_levels`: `[{level: 1, approver_role: "manager"}, ...]`
- `recurrence_pattern`: `{frequency: "monthly", interval: 1, end_date: "..."}`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Migration Fails
1. Check for existing tables with same names
2. Verify foreign key references exist
3. Check for RLS policy conflicts
4. Review migration log for specific error

### If Mock Data Doesn't Appear
1. Verify switch statement includes new tab slugs
2. Check function names match exactly
3. Clear cache and rebuild
4. Verify tab slugs match registry

### If RLS Blocks Access
1. Verify user is workspace member
2. Check workspace_id in queries
3. Review policy definitions
4. Test with superuser role
