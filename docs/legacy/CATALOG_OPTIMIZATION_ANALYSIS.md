## üìä Part 1: Catalog Optimization Opportunities

### A. Organizational Issues

#### 1. Asset Category Consolidation Needed

**Issue:** Inconsistent use of `asset_category` vs `category` fields

**Current Structure:**
```sql
asset_category: 'event_rentals'  -- Top level (used in advances form)
category: 'Restaurant Equipment' -- Subcategory (for organization)
```

**Items Currently Miscategorized:**

| Item | Current Category | Should Be | Reason |
|------|------------------|-----------|--------|
| Restaurant Equipment | event_rentals | site_services OR new 'catering' | More operational than event-specific |
| Office Furniture | event_rentals | new 'office_admin' | Not typically event rental |
| Office Supplies | event_rentals | new 'office_admin' | Consumables, not rentals |
| Janitorial Equipment | site_services | new 'facilities' | Facilities management focus |
| Refrigeration (commercial) | site_services | Could stay or move to 'catering' | Depends on use case |

**Recommendation:** Create new top-level asset_category values:
- `catering` - Restaurant equipment, commercial refrigeration, bar equipment
- `office_admin` - Office furniture, equipment, supplies
- `facilities` - Janitorial equipment and supplies
- Keep `event_rentals` for actual event furniture/decor only

**Impact:** Better filtering in UI, clearer organization, easier for users to find items

---

#### 2. Subcategory Hierarchy Inconsistency

**Issue:** Some categories are too granular, others too broad

**Examples of Over-Granularity:**
- `Ice Machines` (only 4 items) - Could merge into `Refrigeration`
- `Beverage Equipment` (5 items) - Could merge into `Bar Equipment` or `Kitchen Equipment`
- `Tent Accessories` (2 items) - Merge into `Tents`

**Examples of Under-Granularity:**
- `Tables` (contains round, rectangle, cocktail, highboy, bar - 20+ items)
- `Chairs` (contains chiavari, folding, specialty, bar stools - 15+ items)
- `Lighting` (contains uplights, string lights, chandeliers - needs split)

**Recommendation:** Standardize subcategory granularity
- **Merge small categories** (< 5 items) into parent categories
- **Split large categories** (> 15 items) into logical subcategories
- **Target:** 5-15 items per subcategory for optimal browsing

---

#### 3. Duplicate/Similar Items

**Potential Redundancy Found:**

| Item 1 | Item 2 | Issue | Recommendation |
|--------|--------|-------|----------------|
| Wet Floor Caution Sign (Site Safety) | Wet Floor Caution Sign (Janitorial) | Exact duplicate | Keep one, reference in both categories |
| Office Container 20ft Standard | Office Container 20ft Executive | Very similar, minor upgrades | Could consolidate with "finish" option |
| Various folding tables | Multiple sizes of same type | Appropriate variation | Keep but ensure differentiation is clear |

**Action Items:**
1. Remove duplicate wet floor sign from janitorial (keep in safety)
2. Review all container items for consolidation opportunities
3. Ensure size variations are truly needed vs. being selectable options

---

### B. Content Improvements

#### 1. Missing Specification Details

**Items Needing Enhanced Specs:**

**Tents & Structures:**
- Missing: Weight requirements for anchoring
- Missing: Wind rating specifications
- Missing: Setup time estimates
- Missing: Crew size requirements

**Power Equipment:**
- Missing: Fuel consumption rates (some have it, others don't)
- Missing: Noise levels at various distances
- Missing: Power quality specs (THD for sensitive equipment)

**Vehicles:**
- Missing: Insurance requirements
- Missing: Driver license requirements (CDL, etc.)
- Missing: Fuel type consistency

**Recommendation:** Audit all items and add:
- `setup_requirements` - Time, crew size, tools
- `operating_requirements` - Certifications, licenses, training
- `safety_specifications` - Wind ratings, weight limits, noise
- `consumption_rates` - Fuel, power, water usage

---

#### 2. Accessories Standardization

**Issue:** Accessory lists vary wildly in format and completeness

**Current Inconsistencies:**
```json
// Some items have detailed accessories
"accessories": ["battery charger", "extension deck 2ft", "platform gate", "pipe cradle"]

// Others are generic
"accessories": ["standard accessories included"]

// Some missing entirely
"accessories": []
```

**Recommendation:**
- **Audit all 550+ items** for accessory completeness
- **Standardize format:** Always include brackets, even if empty
- **Add missing accessories** based on industry standards
- **Separate** "Included" vs "Optional" vs "Required" accessories

Example improved format:
```json
"accessories": {
  "included": ["item1", "item2"],
  "optional": ["upgrade1", "upgrade2"],
  "required_separate": ["must_rent_separately"]
}
```

---

#### 3. Industry-Specific Terminology Missing

**Film/TV/Broadcast Terms Not Currently Used:**

Common industry terms that users might search for:
- "Basecamp" ‚Üí Office containers
- "Honey wagon" ‚Üí Portable restroom trailers
- "Crafty table" ‚Üí Food service tables
- "Apple box" ‚Üí Various riser sizes
- "C-stand" ‚Üí Stand equipment (missing entirely!)
- "Stinger" ‚Üí Extension cords (missing!)
- "Combo stand" ‚Üí Light stands (missing!)

**Hospitality Terms Not Currently Used:**
- "F&B station" ‚Üí Food & beverage setup
- "BOH" (Back of house) ‚Üí Kitchen equipment
- "FOH" (Front of house) ‚Üí Guest-facing equipment
- "Banquet setup" ‚Üí Various table/chair configurations
- "Housekeeping cart" ‚Üí Janitorial equipment (missing!)

**Recommendation:** Add these terms to `related_names` arrays for existing items, or create new items where missing

---

### C. Search & Discoverability Issues

#### 1. Related Names Gaps

**Analysis of related_names coverage:**

**Well-Covered Items (10+ alternatives):**
- Golf carts: 5 variations
- Fire extinguishers: 6 variations
- Chiavari chairs: 6 variations

**Under-Covered Items (< 3 alternatives):**
- Many office supplies: Only 2-3 terms
- Some refrigeration: Only 2-3 terms
- Specialized equipment: Often only 1-2 terms

**Industry-Specific Terms Missing from related_names:**
- Power distribution boxes missing "spider box", "distro", "lunch box"
- Generators missing "genny", "gennie"
- Trailers missing "goose neck", "tag-along"

**Recommendation:**
- **Target minimum:** 5 related names per item
- **Add industry slang** and regional variations
- **Include common misspellings** in related names
- **Add brand names as search terms** (when appropriate)

---

#### 2. Tag Optimization

**Current Tag Usage:**
```sql
tags: ARRAY['chair', 'chiavari', 'gold', 'banquet', 'wedding']
```

**Issues:**
- Tags are somewhat redundant with category
- Missing use-case tags (ceremony, cocktail-hour, reception)
- Missing capacity tags (indoor-only, outdoor-rated)
- Missing industry tags (film-production, broadcast, hospitality)

**Recommendation:** Enhance tag taxonomy with:
- **Use Case Tags:** ceremony, reception, cocktail-hour, dining, networking
- **Industry Tags:** film-production, tv-production, broadcast, corporate, hospitality, wedding
- **Capacity Tags:** indoor-only, outdoor-rated, weather-resistant
- **Special Requirements:** power-required, setup-intensive, certified-operator

---

### D. Redundancy Analysis

#### 1. Size Variations vs. Options

**Question:** Should we have 6 separate tent items (10x10, 20x20, 20x30, 30x60, 40x80, etc.) or one "Frame Tent" with size as a selectable option?

**Current Approach:** Separate items for each size
**Pros:** 
- Clear pricing per size
- Clear specifications per size
- Simple to understand
**Cons:**
- Many catalog items for similar things
- Harder to maintain
- User has to know exact size needed

**Alternative Approach:** Single item with size variants
**Implementation:**
```json
"size_options": ["10x10", "20x20", "20x30", "30x60", "40x80"],
"pricing_by_size": {"10x10": 500, "20x20": 1000, ...}
```

**Recommendation:** **Keep current approach** for now because:
- Different sizes have different specifications (capacity, accessories)
- Pricing varies significantly
- Setup requirements differ
- Advanced variant system would require schema changes

**But:** Consider this for future enhancement if catalog grows too large

---

#### 2. True Duplicates Found

**Items that are genuine duplicates:**

1. **Wet Floor Caution Sign**
   - Found in: Site Safety (043) AND Janitorial Supplies (054)
   - Action: Remove from janitorial, keep in safety

2. **Similar Office Containers**
   - Multiple 20ft variants with minimal differences
   - Action: Consolidate or ensure clear differentiation

**Recommendation:** Run deduplication audit:
```sql
-- Find potential duplicates by name similarity
SELECT name, COUNT(*), array_agg(category)
FROM assets
WHERE workspace_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
