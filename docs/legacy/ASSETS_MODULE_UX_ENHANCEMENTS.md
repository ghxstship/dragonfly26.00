## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
// Inventory Tab
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<'table' | 'grid'>('table')
const [statusFilter, setStatusFilter] = useState<string | null>(null)
const [selectedItems, setSelectedItems] = useState<string[]>([])

// Counts Tab
const [statusFilter, setStatusFilter] = useState<string | null>(null)
```

### Filter Logic
```typescript
// Apply status filter to data
const filteredData = statusFilter 
  ? data.filter(item => item.status === statusFilter)
  : data
```

### Export Function
```typescript
const handleExport = () => {
  const dataToExport = selectedItems.length > 0 
    ? filteredData.filter(item => selectedItems.includes(item.id))
    : filteredData
  
  // Generate CSV
  const csv = [headers, ...dataToExport.map(formatRow)]
  const csvContent = csv.map(row => row.join(',')).join('\n')
  
  // Download
  const blob = new Blob([csvContent], { type: 'text/csv' })
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
  // ... trigger download
  URL.revokeObjectURL(url)
}
```

### Toast Integration
```typescript
import { useToast } from "@/lib/hooks/use-toast"

const { toast } = useToast()

toast({
  title: "Success",
  description: "Item deleted successfully",
})

toast({
  title: "Error",
  description: "Failed to delete item",
  variant: "destructive",
})
```
