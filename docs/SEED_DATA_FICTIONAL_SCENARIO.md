## 🎯 Demo Data Isolation

### How It Works

All demo data is **flagged with `is_demo = true`** and **only visible to demo users**:

```sql
-- Demo users see only demo data
SELECT * FROM organizations WHERE is_demo = true;

-- Real users see only real data
SELECT * FROM organizations WHERE is_demo = false OR is_demo IS NULL;
```

### RLS Policies

The system automatically filters data based on user type:

- **Demo users** (`is_demo = true` in profiles) → See only demo organizations, projects, tasks, etc.
- **Real users** (`is_demo = false` or `NULL`) → See only real production data

### Benefits

1. **Zero Data Leakage** - Demo and production data never mix
2. **Clean Demos** - Investors see polished fictional scenario
3. **Safe Testing** - Developers can test without affecting real data
4. **Easy Cleanup** - Delete all demo data with one query
