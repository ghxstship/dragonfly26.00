## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Review Migrations
```bash
# Review first migration (48 tables)
cat supabase/migrations/20251020_124604_add_comprehensive_rls_policies.sql | head -100

# Review second migration (51 tables)
cat supabase/migrations/20251020_124646_complete_partial_rls_policies.sql | head -100
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Review policy logic for business requirements
- [ ] Verify table names match schema
- [ ] Confirm role names (admin, owner) are correct
- [ ] Check team_members table reference is valid

### Step 2: Test in Development
```bash
# Apply migrations to development
supabase db push

# Verify application
node scripts/comprehensive-rls-audit.js

# Expected output:
# - Total Tables: 154
# - Tables with Complete RLS: 154 (100%)
# - RLS Security Score: 100/100
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Migrations applied successfully
- [ ] No SQL errors
- [ ] Audit shows 100% coverage
- [ ] Application functions normally

### Step 3: Test RLS Policies
```bash
# Test as regular user
# - Can view own data ✓
# - Cannot view other users' data ✓
# - Can create own data ✓
# - Cannot delete data ✓

# Test as admin
# - Can view team data ✓
# - Can create team data ✓
# - Can update team data ✓
# - Can delete team data ✓
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] User isolation working
- [ ] Team access working
- [ ] Role-based permissions working
- [ ] No unauthorized access possible

### Step 4: Performance Testing
```bash
# Test query performance
# - SELECT queries with RLS
# - INSERT queries with RLS
# - UPDATE queries with RLS
# - DELETE queries with RLS
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] No significant performance degradation
- [ ] Indexes optimized for RLS queries
- [ ] Query plans reviewed

### Step 5: Backup Production
```bash
# Create production backup
supabase db dump > backup_pre_rls_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Verify backup
ls -lh backup_pre_rls_*.sql
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Backup created successfully
- [ ] Backup file size reasonable
- [ ] Backup stored securely

### Step 6: Deploy to Production
```bash
# Apply migrations to production
supabase db push --db-url $PRODUCTION_DB_URL

# Verify deployment
node scripts/comprehensive-rls-audit.js
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Migrations applied successfully
- [ ] No SQL errors in production
- [ ] Audit confirms 100% coverage
- [ ] Application functions normally

### Step 7: Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Monitor application logs
# - Check for RLS policy errors
# - Check for permission denied errors
# - Check for performance issues

# Run comprehensive tests
# - User authentication flow
# - Data access patterns
# - Team collaboration features
# - Admin operations
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] No RLS-related errors
- [ ] Users can access their data
- [ ] Team features working
- [ ] Admin functions working
- [ ] Performance acceptable

## 🔄 ROLLBACK PLAN

If issues arise, follow this rollback procedure:

### Option 1: Rollback Migrations
```bash
# Rollback last migration
supabase migration rollback

# Rollback both migrations
supabase migration rollback
supabase migration rollback
```

### Option 2: Manual Rollback
```sql
-- Disable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE table_name DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop all policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "table_name_select_policy" ON table_name;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "table_name_insert_policy" ON table_name;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "table_name_update_policy" ON table_name;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "table_name_delete_policy" ON table_name;
```

### Option 3: Restore from Backup
```bash
# Restore production backup
psql $PRODUCTION_DB_URL < backup_pre_rls_YYYYMMDD.sql
```
