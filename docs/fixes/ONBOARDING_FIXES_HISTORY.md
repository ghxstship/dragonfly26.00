# Onboarding Fixes - Complete History

This document consolidates all onboarding-related fixes applied to the application.

## Fix #1: Onboarding Skip Bug (Auth Callback)

**Date:** Early Development  
**Issue:** Users could skip onboarding after email confirmation

### Problem
Users were able to bypass onboarding flow, resulting in "User is not a member of any organization" errors.

### Root Causes
1. Auth callback honored `next` URL parameter without checking onboarding status
2. Field name mismatch: code checked `name`, database had `full_name`
3. Invalid redirect path after completion
4. Login page bypassed onboarding check

### Changes
- ✅ `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts` - Always check onboarding first
- ✅ `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx` - Fixed field name to `full_name`
- ✅ `src/app/[locale]/(onboarding)/onboarding/welcome/page.tsx` - Field mapping
- ✅ `src/app/[locale]/(onboarding)/onboarding/complete/page.tsx` - Fixed redirect
- ✅ `src/app/[locale]/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Fixed redirect logic

---

## Fix #2: Profile Schema Mismatch

**Date:** Mid Development  
**Issue:** Schema cache errors for 'title' column

### Problem
Onboarding threw errors: "Could not find the 'title' column of 'profiles' in the schema cache"

### Root Cause
Code used incorrect column names:
- Used `title` → should be `job_title`
- Used `name` → should be `full_name`

### Changes
- ✅ `src/app/[locale]/(onboarding)/onboarding/welcome/page.tsx` - Changed to `job_title`
- ✅ `src/app/api/invitations/send/route.ts` - Changed to `full_name`

### Additional: Locale Routing Fix
All onboarding pages updated to include `/${locale}` prefix in navigation:
- ✅ `welcome/page.tsx`
- ✅ `workspace/page.tsx`
- ✅ `plan/page.tsx`
- ✅ `invite/page.tsx`
- ✅ `complete/page.tsx`

## Fix #3: RLS Policies & Missing Table (Current)

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Migration:** `019_fix_onboarding_rls_policies.sql`  
**Issue:** "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'organizations'"

### Problem
Users could not complete onboarding due to database RLS blocking insert operations.

### Root Causes
1. **Missing INSERT policies** on critical tables:
   - `organizations` - No policy for creating organizations
   - `organization_members` - No policy for joining organizations
   - `workspaces` - No policy for creating workspaces
   - `user_role_assignments` - No policy for role assignments
   - `subscriptions` - Too restrictive policy for initial subscription

2. **Missing table**: `workspace_members` table never created in migrations

3. **Incorrect sequencing**: Code created org → workspace → joined org (violates RLS)

### Migration Changes (019_fix_onboarding_rls_policies.sql)

#### 1. Organizations INSERT Policy
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create organizations"
    ON organizations FOR INSERT
    TO authenticated
    WITH CHECK (true);
```

#### 2. Organization Members Policies
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can join organizations"
    ON organization_members FOR INSERT
    TO authenticated
    WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Users can view organization members in their orgs"
    ON organization_members FOR SELECT
    USING (organization_id IN (
        SELECT organization_id FROM organization_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    ));
```

#### 3. Workspaces INSERT Policy
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Organization creators can create workspaces"
    ON workspaces FOR INSERT
    TO authenticated
    WITH CHECK (
        organization_id IN (
            SELECT id FROM organizations WHERE id = organization_id
        )
    );
```

#### 4. Workspace Members Table (NEW)
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS workspace_members (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    workspace_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES workspaces(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    role TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'member' CHECK (role IN ('owner', 'admin', 'member', 'guest')),
    invited_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    joined_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(workspace_id, user_id)
);
```

With full RLS policies and indexes.

#### 5. User Role Assignments Policies
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can be assigned roles in their organizations"
    ON user_role_assignments FOR INSERT
    TO authenticated
    WITH CHECK (
        user_id = auth.uid()
        OR organization_id IN (
            SELECT organization_id FROM organization_members 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role IN ('owner', 'admin')
        )
    );
```

#### 6. Subscriptions INSERT Policy
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Organization owners can create initial subscriptions"
    ON subscriptions FOR INSERT
    TO authenticated
    WITH CHECK (
        organization_id IN (
            SELECT organization_id FROM organization_members 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'owner'
        )
    );
```

### Code Changes

**File:** `src/app/[locale]/(onboarding)/onboarding/workspace/page.tsx`

Fixed onboarding sequence from:
```
OLD: Create org → Create workspace → Join org → Assign role
```

To:
```
NEW: Create org → Join org → Create workspace → Assign role
```

This ensures user has organization membership **before** creating workspace, satisfying RLS checks.

## Complete Onboarding Flow (After All Fixes)

1. **Sign up** → Email confirmation
2. **Welcome page** → Enter full_name, job_title, bio
3. **Workspace page** → Create organization → Join as owner → Create workspace
4. **Plan page** → Select subscription plan (create free subscription)
5. **Invite page** → Optional team invitations
6. **Complete page** → Redirect to dashboard
7. **Dashboard** → User has full access

## Database Schema Reference

### Profiles Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE profiles (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name TEXT,              -- NOT "name"
    job_title TEXT,              -- NOT "title"
    bio TEXT,
    avatar_url TEXT,
    onboarding_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    onboarding_completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Workspace Members Table (Added in Migration 019)
```sql
CREATE TABLE workspace_members (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    workspace_id UUID NOT NULL,
    organization_id UUID NOT NULL,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    role TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'member',
    invited_by UUID,
