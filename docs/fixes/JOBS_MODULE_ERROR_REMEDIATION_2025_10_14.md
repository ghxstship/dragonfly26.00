# Jobs Module Error Loading Data Remediation - October 14, 2025

## Executive Summary
Identified and fixed critical RLS policy gap causing "Error Loading Data" across all Jobs module tabs. Added proper relationship syntax for user profile and company lookups, and completed table mappings for all tabs.

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - All 8 Jobs module tabs now operational

---

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing RLS Policies for Jobs Tables
**Issue**: Both `job_contracts` and `rfps` tables had Row Level Security (RLS) enabled but **ZERO policies defined**

**Impact**: Complete data access blockage for all 8 tabs
- ❌ Overview tab (dashboard - no data to display)
- ❌ Active tab
- ❌ Pipeline tab
- ❌ Offers tab
- ❌ Shortlists tab
- ❌ RFPs tab
- ❌ Completed tab
- ❌ Archived tab

**Root Cause**: Migration `016_remaining_modules.sql` enabled RLS but never created any policies:
```sql
ALTER TABLE job_contracts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; -- Line 474
ALTER TABLE rfps ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; -- Line 475
-- No policies created! ❌
```

### 2. Incomplete Foreign Key Relationships
**Issue**: User and company references not properly joined in data queries

**Before:**
```typescript
'active': { table: 'job_contracts', select: '*', orderBy: 'start_date' }
```

**Problem**: Selecting `*` only returns UUIDs for `client_id`, `production_id`, and `created_by`

**After:**
```typescript
'active': { 
  table: 'job_contracts', 
  select: '*, client:companies!client_id(name), production:productions!production_id(name), created_by_user:profiles!created_by(first_name, last_name)', 
  orderBy: 'start_date' 
}
```

### 3. Missing Table Mappings
**Issue**: 5 jobs tabs had no table mapping in `tab-page-content.tsx`

**Missing mappings:**
- `pipeline` → `job_contracts`
- `offers` → `job_contracts`
- `shortlists` → `job_contracts`
- `completed` → `job_contracts`
- `archived` → `job_contracts`

**Impact**: CRUD operations would fail for these tabs

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `/supabase/migrations/20251014000000_add_jobs_module_rls_policies.sql` (NEW)
**Purpose**: Add missing RLS policies for job_contracts and rfps tables

**Policies Created:**

#### job_contracts (4 policies):
- ✅ `"Users can view job contracts in their workspace"` (SELECT)
- ✅ `"Users can create job contracts in their workspace"` (INSERT)
- ✅ `"Users can update job contracts in their workspace"` (UPDATE)
- ✅ `"Users can delete job contracts in their workspace"` (DELETE)

#### rfps (4 policies):
- ✅ `"Users can view rfps in their workspace"` (SELECT)
- ✅ `"Users can create rfps in their workspace"` (INSERT)
- ✅ `"Users can update rfps in their workspace"` (UPDATE)
- ✅ `"Users can delete rfps in their workspace"` (DELETE)

**Key Features:**
- Restricts access to workspace members only
- Full CRUD access for workspace members
- Uses workspace_members table for authorization

### 2. `/src/hooks/use-module-data.ts`
**Changes:**

```typescript
// Lines 149-156: Added foreign key relationships
'active': { 
  table: 'job_contracts', 
  select: '*, client:companies!client_id(name), production:productions!production_id(name), created_by_user:profiles!created_by(first_name, last_name)', 
  orderBy: 'start_date' 
},
'pipeline': { 
  table: 'job_contracts', 
  select: '*, client:companies!client_id(name), production:productions!production_id(name), created_by_user:profiles!created_by(first_name, last_name)', 
  orderBy: 'created_at' 
},
'offers': { 
  table: 'job_contracts', 
  select: '*, client:companies!client_id(name), production:productions!production_id(name), created_by_user:profiles!created_by(first_name, last_name)', 
  orderBy: 'created_at' 
},
'shortlists': { 
  table: 'job_contracts', 
  select: '*, client:companies!client_id(name), production:productions!production_id(name), created_by_user:profiles!created_by(first_name, last_name)', 
  orderBy: 'created_at' 
},
'rfps': { 
  table: 'rfps', 
  select: '*, issuer:companies!issuer_id(name), awarded_company:companies!awarded_to(name)', 
  orderBy: 'submission_deadline' 
},
'completed': { 
  table: 'job_contracts', 
  select: '*, client:companies!client_id(name), production:productions!production_id(name), created_by_user:profiles!created_by(first_name, last_name)', 
  orderBy: 'end_date' 
},
'archived': { 
  table: 'job_contracts', 
  select: '*, client:companies!client_id(name), production:productions!production_id(name), created_by_user:profiles!created_by(first_name, last_name)', 
  orderBy: 'end_date' 
},
```

### 3. `/src/components/workspace/tab-page-content.tsx`
**Changes:**

```typescript
// Lines 123-129: Added missing table mappings
'active': 'job_contracts',
'pipeline': 'job_contracts',      // ✅ NEW
'offers': 'job_contracts',        // ✅ NEW
'shortlists': 'job_contracts',    // ✅ NEW
'rfps': 'rfps',
'completed': 'job_contracts',     // ✅ NEW
'archived': 'job_contracts',      // ✅ NEW
```

## Technical Details

### Supabase Foreign Key Syntax

#### For auth.users foreign keys (via profiles):
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
'created_by_user:profiles!created_by(first_name, last_name)'

// Breakdown:
// - created_by_user = alias for joined data
// - profiles = table being joined
// - created_by = column in job_contracts table
// - (first_name, last_name) = fields to select
```

#### For companies foreign keys:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Single reference
'client:companies!client_id(name)'

// ✅ CORRECT - Multiple references to same table
'issuer:companies!issuer_id(name)'
'awarded_company:companies!awarded_to(name)'
```

#### For productions foreign keys:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
'production:productions!production_id(name)'
```

### RLS Policy Structure
Standard pattern for workspace-scoped resources:

```sql
-- SELECT policy (read)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view job contracts in their workspace"
    ON job_contracts FOR SELECT
    USING (
        workspace_id IN (
            SELECT workspace_id 
            FROM workspace_members
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

-- INSERT policy (create)
CREATE POLICY "Users can create job contracts in their workspace"
    ON job_contracts FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (
        workspace_id IN (
            SELECT workspace_id 
            FROM workspace_members
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

-- UPDATE policy (modify)
CREATE POLICY "Users can update job contracts in their workspace"
    ON job_contracts FOR UPDATE
    USING (
        workspace_id IN (
            SELECT workspace_id 
            FROM workspace_members
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

-- DELETE policy (remove)
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete job contracts in their workspace"
    ON job_contracts FOR DELETE
    USING (
        workspace_id IN (
            SELECT workspace_id 
            FROM workspace_members
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
```

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Migration Checklist
When creating tables with RLS:
- [ ] `ALTER TABLE x ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
- [ ] Create SELECT policy
- [ ] Create INSERT policy
- [ ] Create UPDATE policy
- [ ] Create DELETE policy
- [ ] Test policies with real users

### 2. Code Review Checklist
When adding new tabs:
- [ ] Add table mapping to `use-module-data.ts`
- [ ] Add table mapping to `tab-page-content.tsx`
- [ ] Include foreign key relationships in SELECT
- [ ] Verify RLS policies exist for table
- [ ] Test data loading in browser

### 3. Automated Testing
Create integration tests that verify:
- [ ] All tabs load without errors
- [ ] All foreign key relationships resolve
- [ ] RLS policies allow expected access
- [ ] CRUD operations work for each tab
