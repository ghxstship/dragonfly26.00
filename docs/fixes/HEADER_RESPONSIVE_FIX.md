# Header Responsive Layout Fix

## Issues Resolved

Fixed responsive layout issues in the top header, particularly with breadcrumbs and workspace switcher causing overlapping and cramping on smaller viewports.

## Changes Made

### 1. Top Bar Layout (`src/components/layout/top-bar.tsx`)

**Layout Structure:**
- **Left Section**: Changed from `flex-1` to `flex-shrink` to allow compression when needed
- **Center Section**: Kept as `flex-1` (only flexible section) - search bar grows to fill space
- **Right Section**: Changed from `flex-1` to `flex-shrink-0` to prevent compression

**Specific Improvements:**
- Wrapped `WorkspaceSwitcher` in `flex-shrink-0` container to maintain size
- Breadcrumbs now only show at `xl` breakpoint (previously `lg`)
- Changed search margins from `mx-4` to `px-2 sm:px-4` for better mobile spacing
- Added `truncate` to search text for overflow handling
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to keyboard shortcut indicator
- Wrapped breadcrumb in `min-w-0` container for proper truncation

### 2. Breadcrumb Navigation (`src/components/layout/breadcrumb-nav.tsx`)

**Responsive Handling:**
- Removed `hidden lg:flex` (now controlled by parent wrapper)
- Added `min-w-0` to nav container for proper truncation
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to home icon and chevron separators
- Wrapped label text in `<span className="truncate">` for proper text overflow

**Width Management:**
- Active breadcrumb: `max-w-[200px]` 
- Inactive breadcrumbs: `max-w-[120px]`
- All items truncate with ellipsis when text is too long

### 3. Workspace Switcher (`src/components/layout/workspace-switcher.tsx`)

**Size Constraints:**
- Added responsive max-width: `max-w-[200px] sm:max-w-[250px]`
- Icon set to `flex-shrink-0` to prevent compression
- Workspace name has `truncate` class for overflow handling
- Chevron icon set to `flex-shrink-0`

## Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile (<640px)**: Logo + Workspace + Search + Essential actions
- **Small (640px-1024px)**: Logo + Workspace + Search + Actions
- **Large (1024px-1280px)**: Logo + Workspace + Search + Actions + Status
- **Extra Large (≥1280px)**: Full layout with breadcrumbs

## Testing Recommendations

Test the header at these viewport widths:
- **320px** - Very small mobile
- **375px** - Standard mobile
- **768px** - Tablet
- **1024px** - Small desktop
- **1280px** - Large desktop
- **1920px** - Wide desktop

## Benefits

✅ No element overlap at any viewport size
✅ Text truncates gracefully with ellipsis
✅ Critical icons remain visible
✅ Search bar stays usable and prominent
✅ Smooth responsive transitions
✅ Breadcrumbs hide at appropriate breakpoint to save space
