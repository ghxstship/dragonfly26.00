## üîí RLS POLICY STRUCTURE

All policies follow a consistent, secure pattern:

### 1. SELECT Policy
```sql
CREATE POLICY "table_name_select_policy"
  ON table_name
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    auth.uid() = user_id
    OR auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT user_id FROM team_members
      WHERE team_id = table_name.team_id
    )
  );
```
**Purpose:** Users can view their own data or data from their team

### 2. INSERT Policy
```sql
CREATE POLICY "table_name_insert_policy"
  ON table_name
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    auth.uid() = user_id
    OR auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT user_id FROM team_members
      WHERE team_id = table_name.team_id
      AND role IN ('admin', 'owner')
    )
  );
```
**Purpose:** Users can create their own data, or admins/owners can create team data

### 3. UPDATE Policy
```sql
CREATE POLICY "table_name_update_policy"
  ON table_name
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    auth.uid() = user_id
    OR auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT user_id FROM team_members
      WHERE team_id = table_name.team_id
      AND role IN ('admin', 'owner')
    )
  );
```
**Purpose:** Users can update their own data, or admins/owners can update team data

### 4. DELETE Policy
```sql
CREATE POLICY "table_name_delete_policy"
  ON table_name
  FOR DELETE
  USING (
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT user_id FROM team_members
      WHERE team_id = table_name.team_id
      AND role IN ('admin', 'owner')
    )
  );
```
**Purpose:** Only admins/owners can delete data

## üìã VERIFICATION

### Automated Verification
```bash
# Run comprehensive audit
node scripts/comprehensive-rls-audit.js

# Expected output:
# Total Tables: 154
# Tables with Complete RLS: 154 (100%)
# Tables with Partial RLS: 0 (0%)
# Tables without RLS: 0 (0%)
# RLS Security Score: 100/100
```

### Manual Verification
```bash
# Count total tables
grep -rh "CREATE TABLE" supabase/migrations/*.sql | \
  sed 's/CREATE TABLE //' | sed 's/ (.*//' | \
  sed 's/IF NOT EXISTS //' | sort -u | wc -l
# Expected: 154

# Count total RLS policies
grep -rh "CREATE POLICY" supabase/migrations/*.sql | wc -l
# Expected: 616+ (154 tables √ó 4 policies minimum)

# Verify RLS enabled on all tables
grep -rh "ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY" supabase/migrations/*.sql | wc -l
# Expected: 154+
```

# Or manually drop policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "table_name_select_policy" ON table_name;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "table_name_insert_policy" ON table_name;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "table_name_update_policy" ON table_name;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "table_name_delete_policy" ON table_name;
