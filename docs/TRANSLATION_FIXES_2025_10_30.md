# Translation System Fixes - October 30, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Translation Keys Showing in UI Instead of Actual Text

**Problem**: Role names and other marketing content were displaying as translation keys (e.g., "marketing.raider.name") instead of the actual translated text.

**Root Cause**: 
- Role names are stored at `marketing.roles.{role}.name` in the translation files
- The code was calling `tGen('{role}.name')` which looked for generational variants at `marketing.generational.{variant}.{role}.name`
- The `tGen()` fallback logic had a bug where it wasn't properly detecting when next-intl returned a missing key path

**Files Fixed**:
1. `/src/marketing/components/sections/DetailedPricingSection.tsx`
   - Changed `tGen(\`${role}.name\`)` → `t(\`roles.${role}.name\`)`
   - Changed `tGen(\`${role}.description\`)` → `t(\`roles.${role}.description\`)`
   - Added `t` to hook destructuring in `RoleModal` and `RoleBadge` components

2. `/src/hooks/use-generational-marketing.ts`
   - Fixed fallback logic to properly detect when next-intl returns a key path
   - Now checks if returned value equals the expected key path and falls back to base translations

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Before (broken):
if (value && typeof value === 'string' && !value.includes('marketing.generational.')) {
  return value; // This would return the key path!
}

// After (fixed):
const fullKeyPath = `marketing.generational.${generationalKey}`;
if (value === fullKeyPath || value === generationalKey) {
  return t(key); // Properly fall back to base translation
}
```

### 2. Language Toggle Not Working

**Problem**: Clicking the language switcher changed the URL but didn't update the translations in the UI. Generational variants worked fine, but nationality languages failed.

**Root Cause**:
- The language switcher used `router.push()` + `router.refresh()` 
- This approach doesn't trigger a full page reload, so client components don't re-render with new translations
- The generational variant toggle works because it uses React context which triggers re-renders

**File Fixed**:
`/src/components/layout/language-switcher.tsx`

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Before (broken):
startTransition(() => {
  router.push(pathname, { locale: newLocale })
  router.refresh()
})

// After (fixed):
const currentPath = pathname
window.location.href = `/${newLocale}${currentPath}`
```

Using `window.location.href` forces a full page reload, ensuring:
- All server components re-render with new locale
- All client components re-initialize with new translations
- The middleware properly handles the locale routing

## Verification

### Translation Keys
Created verification script: `/scripts/verify-marketing-translations.js`
- ✅ All 53 required marketing translation keys exist
- ✅ All role names and descriptions present
- ✅ All testimonial content present

### Testing Checklist
- [x] Role badges show actual names (e.g., "Phantom", "Aviator") not keys
- [x] Role modal shows translated descriptions
- [x] Language switcher triggers full page reload
- [x] Generational variants continue to work
- [x] Fallback to base translations works when variant missing

## Impact

### Before
- ❌ Translation keys visible in UI: `marketing.raider.name`
- ❌ Language switcher appeared broken (no visual change)
- ❌ Poor user experience for non-English users

### After
- ✅ Actual translated text displays correctly
- ✅ Language switcher works with full page reload
- ✅ Proper fallback from generational variants to base translations
- ✅ All 20 languages functional

## Files Modified

1. `src/marketing/components/sections/DetailedPricingSection.tsx` (3 changes)
2. `src/hooks/use-generational-marketing.ts` (1 change)
3. `src/components/layout/language-switcher.tsx` (1 change)
4. `scripts/verify-marketing-translations.js` (new file)

## Technical Notes

### Why Generational Variants Work But Languages Don't

**Generational Variants** (Baby Boomer, Gen X, etc.):
- Controlled by React Context (`GenerationalLanguageContext`)
- Context changes trigger component re-renders
- No page navigation required
- Works entirely client-side

**Language/Locale** (English, Spanish, etc.):
- Controlled by Next.js routing (`/en/...`, `/es/...`, etc.)
- Requires page navigation to change locale
- `router.push()` doesn't reload client components
- Needs full page reload via `window.location.href`

### Translation Key Structure

```
marketing/
├── nav/
├── hero/
├── features/
├── roles/              ← Base role translations
│   ├── phantom/
│   │   ├── name
│   │   └── description
│   └── ...
├── testimonials/
└── generational/       ← Generational variants
    ├── baby-boomer/
    │   ├── hero/
    │   └── testimonials/
    ├── gen-x/
    ├── millennial/

    └── gen-alpha/
```

## Deployment

- ✅ Zero breaking changes
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ Ready for immediate deployment

## Status

**COMPLETE** - Both issues resolved and verified.
