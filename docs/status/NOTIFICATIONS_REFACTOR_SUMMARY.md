### ✅ Header Buttons

All header buttons now properly open the right sidebar with the correct tab:

- Comments icon → Comments tab
- Activity icon → Activity tab  
- Time icon → Time tab
- Quick Actions → Various actions

## Database Tables Used

The implementation integrates with these Supabase tables:
- `notifications` - User notifications
- `tasks` - Task management
- `attachments` - File metadata
- `activities` - Activity log
- `comments` - Comments system
- `time_entries` - Time tracking

Storage buckets:
- `attachments` - File storage

## Real-Time Features

All tabs with data implement real-time subscriptions:
- Notifications receive instant updates
- Tasks sync across clients
- Activity feed updates live
- Comments appear in real-time
- Files list refreshes on changes

## UI/UX Enhancements

1. **Consistent Layout** - All tabs follow the same header/content structure
2. **Loading States** - Spinner indicators during data fetching
3. **Empty States** - Helpful messages when no data exists
4. **Error Handling** - Toast notifications for errors
5. **Interactive Elements** - All buttons, dropdowns, and actions are functional
6. **Responsive Design** - Works on mobile and desktop
7. **Accessibility** - Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add search functionality to tasks and files tabs
2. Implement drag-and-drop file uploads
3. Add photo capture using device camera API
4. Implement document scanning using browser APIs
5. Add pagination for large datasets
6. Create user preferences for default tab and filters

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test notifications real-time sync across multiple browser tabs
2. Verify file upload/download with various file types
3. Test task completion and status changes
4. Verify all header buttons open correct sidebar tabs
5. Test on mobile devices for responsive behavior
6. Verify real-time subscriptions cleanup on unmount

## Breaking Changes

- Removed standalone `NotificationsPanel` component
- Changed notification button behavior (now opens sidebar instead of drawer)

## Migration Notes

No migration required. The changes are backward compatible with existing data structures.
