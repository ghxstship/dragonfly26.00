## Implementation Details

### Stripe Hosted Checkout

We're using **Stripe's hosted checkout pages** (not building custom checkout in the app). This is the most scalable approach because:

1. **PCI Compliance:** Stripe handles all payment data - you never touch card details
2. **Security:** Stripe's checkout is battle-tested and secure
3. **Features:** Automatic support for:
   - Multiple payment methods
   - 3D Secure authentication
   - Tax calculation
   - Promotional codes
   - Trial periods
4. **Maintenance:** Stripe updates the checkout UI with new features automatically
5. **Mobile Optimized:** Works perfectly on all devices
6. **Localization:** Supports 25+ languages automatically

### Webhook Integration

All subscription events are handled automatically via webhooks:
- ✅ Subscription creation
- ✅ Subscription updates
- ✅ Subscription cancellation
- ✅ Payment success
- ✅ Payment failure
- ✅ Trial expiration

## Next Steps (For You)

### 1. Create Stripe Products (15 minutes)

Follow the guide in `/docs/STRIPE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` Step 1:

1. Log into Stripe Dashboard
2. Create 4 products (Pro, Team, Enterprise, Additional Seat)
3. Create 2 prices for each (monthly and annual)
4. Copy all 8 price IDs

### 2. Configure Environment Variables (5 minutes)

Add to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Get these from Stripe Dashboard → Developers → API keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxx
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxx

# Paste the price IDs you copied from Step 1
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_MONTHLY=price_xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_ANNUAL=price_xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_TEAM_MONTHLY=price_xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_TEAM_ANNUAL=price_xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ENTERPRISE_MONTHLY=price_xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ENTERPRISE_ANNUAL=price_xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ADDITIONAL_SEAT_MONTHLY=price_xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ADDITIONAL_SEAT_ANNUAL=price_xxxxx
```

### 3. Set Up Webhook (10 minutes)

Follow the guide Step 3:

1. Create webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard
2. Point it to: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Select the required events (listed in guide)
4. Copy webhook signing secret
5. Add to `.env.local` as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

For local testing, use Stripe CLI:
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

### 4. Run Database Migration (2 minutes)

```bash
supabase db push
```

This creates the `subscriptions` table with all required fields and RLS policies.

### 5. Test the Flow (10 minutes)

1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/onboarding/plan`
3. Toggle between Monthly and Annual
4. Select a paid plan
5. Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
6. Complete checkout
7. Verify subscription in database
