- Implement proper TypeScript typing
- Include responsive design
- Feature interactive elements and filtering where appropriate

## Integration

All views are registered in `/src/lib/views/registry.ts` and can be accessed through the `ViewSwitcher` component. The views are compatible with the module system and can be filtered based on module requirements.

## Next Steps

To use these views in your application:
1. Import the desired view component
2. Pass your data array and optional callbacks
3. The view will handle rendering and interactions
4. Use the ViewSwitcher component for easy navigation between view types
