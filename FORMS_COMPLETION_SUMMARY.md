2. **Matching Dialog Titles:** Dialog title matches button text
3. **Action-Oriented Submit:** "Submit Expense" not generic "Create"
4. **Helper Function:** `getCreateButtonLabel(moduleId, tabSlug)`
5. **Fallback System:** Generic labels for unmapped tabs

   - Helper function `getCreateButtonLabel()`
   
2. `/src/lib/modules/form-fields-extended.ts`
   - Events, Locations, Companies, Marketplace, Procurement
   - Reports, Analytics, Insights modules

3. `/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/workspace/[workspaceId]/[module]/[tab]/page.tsx`
   - Integrated `getCreateButtonLabel()` for contextual buttons

## üîú Remaining Work (40 forms + 3 forms)

### High Priority - Critical Workflows

Each form needs:
```typescript
'tab-slug': {
  title: 'Action + Object',           // e.g., "Upload Document"
  description: 'Brief description',   // e.g., "Upload production document"
  submitLabel: 'Action + Object',     // e.g., "Upload Document"
  fields: [
    // Field configurations
  ]
}
```
