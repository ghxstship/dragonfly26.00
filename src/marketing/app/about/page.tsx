          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            ATLVS was born from frustration. As production professionals, we were tired of juggling spreadsheets, emails, and disconnected tools. We knew there had to be a better way.
          </p>
          <p>
            In [Year], we set out to build the platform we wished existedâ€”one that understood the unique challenges of live entertainment production. Today, ATLVS powers productions worldwide, from intimate events to massive festivals.
