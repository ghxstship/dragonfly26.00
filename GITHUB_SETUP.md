# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

Since GitHub CLI installation requires system permissions, here's how to create your repository:

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Personal Access Token
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Token name: `Dragonfly26.00 Repo Creation`
3. Expiration: 7 days (or as needed)
4. Select scopes:
   - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Set the Token Locally
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

### Step 3: Run This Command
I'll provide a curl command to create the repository once you have the token.

## Alternative: Manual Setup (Recommended)

### 1. Create Repository on GitHub
- Go to: https://github.com/new
- Repository name: **Dragonfly26.00**
- Description: *Modern project management platform with Next.js, Supabase, Stripe, and multi-language support*
- Privacy: Choose **Private** or **Public**
- **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT check:
  - ❌ Add a README file
  - ❌ Add .gitignore
  - ❌ Choose a license
  
### 2. Copy Your Repository URL
After creating, GitHub will show you a URL like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Dragonfly26.00.git
```

### 3. Connect and Push
Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/julianclarkson/Documents/Dragonfly26.00

# Add the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Dragonfly26.00.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
