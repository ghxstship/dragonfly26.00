# Settings Module Implementation Complete

## Overview
The Settings module has been successfully implemented with all requested contextual tabs using the standardized `ModuleTab` system. The module is accessible via the sidebar at `/workspace/[workspaceId]/settings/[tab]`.

> **Note**: This module was refactored to use the standard ModuleTab system instead of an ad hoc tabs implementation. See `SETTINGS_REFACTOR_COMPLETE.md` for details on the refactoring.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Routing Structure
- **Module Registry**: `/src/lib/modules/registry.ts`
  - Settings registered as a system module with `has_tabs: true`
- **Tab Registry**: `/src/lib/modules/tabs-registry.ts`
  - All 6 settings tabs registered using `ModuleTab` interface
- **Route Handler**: Standard `/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/workspace/[workspaceId]/[module]/[tab]/page.tsx`
  - Handles settings tabs via `getSettingsTabComponent()` lookup
  - No view switcher or data controls for settings tabs

## Integration Notes

### Sidebar Integration
The Settings link in the sidebar has been updated:
- Location: `/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`
- Links to: `/workspace/[workspaceId]/settings/appearance`
- Active state highlights when on any settings route

### Module Registry
- Settings is registered as a system module in `registry.ts`
- Settings tabs are registered in `tabs-registry.ts` using the `ModuleTab` interface
- Settings uses the same routing pattern as other modules: `/[module]/[tab]`

## Features by Tab

| Tab | Key Features |
|-----|-------------|
| **Appearance** | Theme mode, accent colors, custom backgrounds, CSS injection, animations |
| **Integrations** | Org & personal integrations, connection management, marketplace-style UI |
| **Automations** | Trigger/action workflows, automation builder, statistics dashboard |
| **Account** | Profile management, security settings, data export, account deletion |
| **Team** | Member directory, role management, invitations, status tracking |
| **Billing** | Plans, payment methods, invoices, usage tracking, upgrades |

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Test the Implementation**:
   - Navigate to the Settings page via the sidebar
   - Test each tab's functionality
   - Verify responsive design on different screen sizes

3. **Backend Integration** (Future):
   - Connect to Supabase for data persistence
   - Implement actual integration OAuth flows
   - Add Stripe integration for billing
   - Implement automation execution engine

## TypeScript Notes

Some TypeScript errors may appear initially due to caching. These will resolve after:
- Restarting the TypeScript server in your IDE
- Running `npm install` to install the new package
- Rebuilding the project with `npm run build`

## Design Philosophy

The Settings module follows these principles:
- **User-centric**: Focused on individual user preferences and account management
- **Organization-aware**: Distinguishes between personal and organization-level settings
- **Modern UX**: Clean, intuitive interface with clear visual hierarchy
- **Customizable**: MySpace-style personalization for power users
- **Professional**: Enterprise-grade features like automations and integrations

The implementation is complete and ready for testing!
