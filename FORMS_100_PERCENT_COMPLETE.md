## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Form Configuration Structure
```typescript
export interface TabFormConfig {
  title: string              // Action-oriented title (e.g., "Submit Expense")
  description: string        // Brief description
  submitLabel: string        // Submit button text
  fields: FormFieldConfig[]  // Array of field configurations
}

export interface FormFieldConfig {
  name: string
  label: string
  type: FieldType           // 30+ supported types
  required?: boolean
  defaultValue?: any
  options?: Array<{value: string; label: string}>
  validation?: {...}
  // ... and more
}
```

### Integration Points
```typescript
// Get form configuration
const config = getFormConfig('finance', 'expenses')

// Get button label for UI
const buttonLabel = getCreateButtonLabel('finance', 'expenses')
// Returns: "Submit Expense"
```
