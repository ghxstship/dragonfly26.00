# Onboarding Skip Bug - Fixed

## Problem Summary
Users were able to skip onboarding after confirming their email, resulting in the error:
**"User is not a member of any organization"**

This happened because users were being redirected directly to the dashboard without completing the onboarding flow where they create/join an organization.

## Root Causes

### 1. **Auth Callback Bypassing Onboarding**
The `auth/callback/route.ts` was honoring the `next` URL parameter without first checking if onboarding was completed. When users clicked email confirmation links with redirect parameters like `/dashboard`, they would skip onboarding entirely.

### 2. **Field Name Mismatch**
The code was checking for a `name` field in profiles, but the database table has `full_name`. This caused the onboarding check to fail even when users had entered their name.

### 3. **Invalid Redirect Path**
The onboarding completion page was redirecting to `/workspace/` (empty workspace ID) instead of a valid path.

### 4. **Login Redirect Issue**
The login page was redirecting directly to the dashboard without checking onboarding status.

## Changes Made

### ✅ **1. Fixed Auth Callback** (`src/app/auth/callback/route.ts`)
- **ALWAYS** check onboarding status first, regardless of the `next` parameter
- Only honor the `next` parameter if user has completed onboarding
- Fixed field name from `name` to `full_name`

```typescript
// Now checks onboarding BEFORE using next parameter
if (!profile?.onboarding_completed || !profile?.full_name) {
  redirectPath = `/${locale}/onboarding/welcome`
}
```

### ✅ **2. Fixed Root Page** (`src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`)
- Fixed field name from `name` to `full_name` to match database schema

### ✅ **3. Fixed Welcome Page** (`src/app/[locale]/(onboarding)/onboarding/welcome/page.tsx`)
- Map `full_name` from database to local `name` state
- Save `name` state as `full_name` in database

### ✅ **4. Fixed Complete Page** (`src/app/[locale]/(onboarding)/onboarding/complete/page.tsx`)
- Redirect to proper dashboard path with workspace ID
- Fallback to `/workspace/personal/dashboard/overview` if no workspace ID

### ✅ **5. Fixed Login Page** (`src/app/[locale]/(auth)/login/page.tsx`)
- Redirect to root path `/` instead of directly to dashboard
- Root page handles onboarding check and proper routing

## Supabase Configuration

### ⚠️ **Recommended Changes to URL Configuration**

Based on the screenshot provided, your current Supabase URL configuration has:
```
Redirect URLs:
  - https://dragonfly2600.vercel.app/auth/callback  ✅ KEEP
  - https://dragonfly2600.vercel.app/dashboard      ❌ REMOVE
  - https://dragonfly2600.vercel.app                ✅ KEEP
```

**Action Required:**
1. **Remove** `https://dragonfly2600.vercel.app/dashboard` from redirect URLs
   - This is not a valid route in your app
   - It could cause users to skip onboarding

2. **Keep only:**
   - `https://dragonfly2600.vercel.app/auth/callback` (primary auth callback)
   - `https://dragonfly2600.vercel.app` (root - handles routing)

### Why This Matters
Even though the code now checks onboarding status regardless of the `next` parameter, removing invalid redirect URLs prevents confusion and ensures cleaner URL handling.

## Testing Checklist

Test the following scenarios to verify the fix:

- [ ] **New User Signup**
  1. Sign up with email
  2. Confirm email via link
  3. Should be redirected to `/onboarding/welcome`
  4. Complete all onboarding steps
  5. Should reach dashboard successfully

- [ ] **Existing User Login**
  1. Log in with completed profile
  2. Should go directly to dashboard

- [ ] **Incomplete Onboarding**
  1. Sign up but don't complete onboarding
  2. Log out and log back in
  3. Should be redirected to onboarding, not dashboard

- [ ] **OAuth (Google) Signup**
  1. Sign up with Google
  2. Should be redirected to onboarding
  3. Complete onboarding
  4. Should reach dashboard

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### For New Users:
1. Sign up → Email confirmation → Onboarding (Welcome) → Create/Join Workspace → Select Plan → Complete → Dashboard
2. **No way to skip onboarding** even with URL manipulation

### For Returning Users:
1. Login → Dashboard (if onboarding complete)
2. Login → Onboarding (if onboarding incomplete)

## Database Schema Note

The `profiles` table uses `full_name` (not `name`). All code now correctly uses this field name.

```sql
-- profiles table structure (relevant fields)
CREATE TABLE profiles (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name TEXT,              -- ✅ Correct field name
    avatar_url TEXT,
    onboarding_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    -- ... other fields
);
```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts` - Fixed onboarding check priority
2. ✅ `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx` - Fixed field name
3. ✅ `src/app/[locale]/(onboarding)/onboarding/welcome/page.tsx` - Fixed field mapping
4. ✅ `src/app/[locale]/(onboarding)/onboarding/complete/page.tsx` - Fixed redirect path
5. ✅ `src/app/[locale]/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Fixed redirect logic

## Deployment

After deploying these changes:
1. Update Supabase URL configuration as recommended above
2. Test with a fresh signup
3. Monitor for any "User is not a member of any organization" errors

---

**Issue Resolved:** Users can no longer skip onboarding, ensuring they always create/join an organization before accessing the dashboard.
